Class name : StatsScoreboard.StatsScoreboard

This mutator will record everyone's contribution - kill count,dosh earned,damage healed,headshots,large zed killed count and damage caused ,then print out the person with the highest value,just like what kf2 did when game ends.

When match is over, you will see message like this: ZedsButcher : MaxLykoS 365

There are 8 kinds in total :
HealingMaster
ZedsButcher
Destroyer
GiantKiller
MoneyBag
SkullCracker

Easy to understand.
And the 'headshot' means 'shot in the head' including decapitation.
